Excellent study notes (not by me):  https://github.com/Leverege/gcp-data-engineer-exam

Passed the Passed the Data Engineer exam on Friday 8/28/20.  That test was alot harder than the Pro Architect.  According to the anecdotal results I got from the tester guy he said about 70% pass the architect and about 50% pass the Data Engineer.  LOTS of questions on BQ that weren't covered in Linux Academy.  Make sure you spend extra time hands on, going over docs, etc. for that one.

My personal study notes are in this repo as both a One note archive and word document.
